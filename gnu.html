    <h1>digital freedom is a must</h1>
    <p>in an educational environment free softwware philosophy is a must. <b>in terms of software "free" does not mean free as in price but rather free as in freedom.</b>
        the freedom to have <b>full control of your hardware and full acess to the source code of
        the software you run</b> is essential for education and computer education.
        for example: today when proprietary vermin runs on the vast majority of desktop computers;
        computer illiteracy is on the rise, many students dont even know what a deirectory is!
        despite that most schools in israel including ours run the proprietary windows which isnt even ran on servers and is useless for proffesional use
        instead of linux which helps you understand your computer and will help you in your future career
        <h3>encoureging software freedom is encoureging the understanding of software and should be a goal in all educational facilities</h3> 
        if phones will be taken not only will students not have control over their own machines but they wouldnt even be able to access them at all.
        students will graduate school without the skills or even the mindset they need to function in the digital age freely. digital literacy in this school is already amusing, <b>there is no point to teaching python or c# to people who dont even know what a computer is.</b>
        if you think learning syntax makes you educated you are gravely mistaken
